# Task 08 – VPN Setup and Privacy Testing  

## 🎯 Objective  
To gain hands-on experience with VPNs, understand how they secure communication, and test their impact on privacy and browsing.  

---

## 🔍 Steps Taken  
1. Installed **ProtonVPN Free**.  
2. Created a free account and logged in.  
3. Connected to a server in [Server Location].  
4. Verified new IP using [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com).  
5. Browsed websites to confirm encryption and connectivity.  
6. Disconnected and compared speed and IP.

## 📂 Results  
- **Before VPN:** IP showed as [Your Original Location].  
- **After VPN:** IP changed to [VPN Server Location].  
- **Connection Status:** Verified via ProtonVPN client screenshot.  
- **Speed Impact:** Slight reduction in browsing speed, but stable connection.

## 🛡️ Key Learnings  
- VPN encrypts internet traffic and hides real IP.  
- VPN provides better privacy and bypasses geo-restrictions.  
- VPN cannot guarantee **100% anonymity** (provider logs, advanced tracking still possible).  
- VPNs may reduce speed due to encryption overhead.

## 📂 Deliverables  
- Screenshot of VPN connected status.  
- Screenshot of changed IP (optional).  
- This README report.
